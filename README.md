a:link{} unvisited links on the web page
a:link(pseudo class) often starts with a:something
Pseudo-classes: specify styling in these states.

:link — unvisited link
:visited — visited state
:focus — the currently "focused" (selected) element
:hover — hover your mouse over this
:active — the time between the link is selected and the time the page loads. (Not used much today.)
If you are using these pseudo-classes, they MUST go in the order listed.
